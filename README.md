# bonacrypto

BonaCrypto is an e-commerce concept promoting the act of charity in the cryptoeconomy. The mission of BonaCrypto is to increase enthusiasm for cryptocurrency adoption by selling simple t-shirts and donating all profits to crypto-native charities via smart contract utilization. The aim is to make all business transactions and donations visible to the public in order to guarantee transparency and accountability. 

We find in [bona-crypto.myshopify.com](url) the Shopify interface by which customers will purchase BonaCrypto t-shirts. Shopify displays the apparel for sale, which are simply designed black t-shirts with simple coin logos imprinted on the left chest. The platform also allows the customer to easily purchase the t-shirts with cryptocurrency via integration with Coinbase Commerce. 

Shopify's integration with Coinbase Commerce gives BonaCrypto the capacity to easily utilize smart contracts to streamline profits to charities. Once Shopify receives cryptocurrency payments from the customer and transfers it over to Coinbase Commerce, the money in the system will be donated to charities that currently accept cryptocurrencies. 

The donation process will be faciliated by the BonaCrypto smart contract. The code for the contract is published into this repository. The following is the list of functionalities that the contract supports : 

(1) Donating ether to a charity
(2) Registering a charity subject to BonaCrypto donations  
(2) Removing a registered charity  
(3) Viewing the total list of charities registered  
(4) Viewing a summary of a charity including wallet address and accumulated donation amount information  
  
* It is important to note that the contract only supports Ether-based donations at the current stage. An improved iteration of the concept will need to generalize for a wider range of coins.
